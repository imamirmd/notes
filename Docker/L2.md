#### Docker Version

```shell
docker --version
```

```shell
sudo docker version # required to connect to dockerd
```

---
#### Docker-wide Information

```shell
sudo docker info
```

---
#### Download an Image

```shell
sudo docker pull <repository[:tag]> 
```

- **repository** is the name of the image collection, usually representing an application or service (for example: `nginx`, `python`, `myapp/backend`).

- **Tag** is the version or variant of the image inside the repository (for example: `latest`, `1.25`, `3.12-slim`).

```shell
# example
sudo docker pull nginx:latest # will download ngnix from Docker Hub
```

**Note**: Do not use ***latest tag*** in production. 

---
#### Listing Images 

```shell
sudo docker images # default hides intermediate images
```

```shell
sudo docker images -a # shows all images
```

```shell
sudo docker images -q # shows only image IDs
```

---
#### Listing Containers

```shell
sudo docker ps # shows just running
```

```shell
sudo docker ps -a # showsall containers
```

```shell
sudo docker ps -q # shows only container IDs
```

```shell
sudo docker ps -n <last: int = -1> # shows n last created containers (includes all states)
```

```shell
sudo docker ps -l # shows the latest created containers (all states)
```

```shell
sudo docker ps -s # shows container/image sizes
```

```shell
sudo docker ps --no-trunc # don't truncate output
```

```shell
sudo docker ps -a -f status=<status: str>
```

- **created**
	The container is created but **has not started** yet.

- **running**
	The container’s main process is **currently running**.
	
- **paused** 
	The container is temporarily **frozen** (processes are stopped using cgroups).

- **restarting** 
	The container is **stopping and starting again** (usually due to a restart policy).

- **removing** 
	The container is in the process of **being deleted**.

- **exited** 
	The container has **stopped** because its main process ended or crashed.

- **dead** 
	The container **failed to stop or be removed cleanly** and is in an inconsistent state.

---
#### Create a container (instance of an image)

```shell
sudo docker run <repository[:tag]>
```

```shell
sudo docker run <registry>/<repository[:tag]>
```

**Note**: The default registry is *Docker Hub*, but you can change it.

**Note**: `docker run` will automatically pull the image if the image does not exist locally.

---
#### Pulling an Image

```shell
sudo docker pull <registry>/<repository[:tag]>
```
